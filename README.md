## üîÑ Current Conversion Flow

1. **Upload Images:**  
   Users drag & drop images or click to add files. Each image is listed with its file name, a dropdown for selecting the target format, a remove button, and a status (default: ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù). If more than 10 files are added, the upload is blocked and a popup alert is shown.

2. **Select Formats:**  
   For each image in the list, users select a desired output format (e.g., JPG, PNG, WEBP). This information is saved client-side‚Äîno conversion occurs yet.

3. **Convert Images:**  
   When the user clicks the **Convert** button, JavaScript loops through the list of images (that haven‚Äôt been converted and have a target format) and:
   - Updates the status to ‚ÄúProcessing‚Ä¶‚Äù
   - Sends an AJAX POST request per file, including the file and the selected format.
   - The backend validates, temporarily stores the file, converts it using Intervention Image, and saves it to `storage/app/public/converted`.
   - The conversion is logged in the database (for the conversion counter) and the backend returns a JSON response with status, download URL, and converted file size.

4. **Display Results:**  
   Each image‚Äôs status is updated to ‚ÄúFinished ‚úÖ‚Äù with a download button on success. On failure, the status shows ‚ÄúFailed ‚ùå‚Äù along with an optional error tooltip or retry prompt.

5. **User Interaction Continues:**  
   Users can add new images (while already converted ones remain in the list), download finished images at any time, or remove images from the list.

6. **Real-Time Conversion Counter:**  
   A periodic AJAX GET request to `/conversion-count` provides live stats like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already converted 2,551,238,187 files with a total size of 20,010 TB.‚Äù

> **Note:** This describes the current version; a new, upgraded algorithm is in development for even more powerful, AJAX-based multi-image processing.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Development should be an enjoyable and creative experience. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing)
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container)
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent)
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations)
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues)
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting)

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides the tools necessary for building large, robust applications.
